* dired-recent [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/dired-recent][file:http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/dired-recent-badge.svg]]
  A history of paths visited with Emacs dired.

** Installation

   Install from MELPA.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x package-install dired-recent
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage

   1. Enable the global minor mode.

      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
        (dired-recent-mode 1)
      #+END_SRC

   2. Press =C-x C-d= to select a previously visited directory to
      open.

      A package like [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy][Ivy]] greatly improves the experience.

** Additional info

   =dired-recent-mode= hijacks the =C-x C-d= key that in theory it
   shouldn't. I decided that this key is so useless by default and at
   the same time would make much sense for =dired-recent=, that I'm
   going to use it. If you're uncomfortable with it, you can unbind it
   with the following code. Note that =dired-recent= must be already
   loaded.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (define-key dired-recent-mode-map (kbd "C-x C-d") nil)
     (define-key dired-recent-mode-map (kbd "SOME OTHER KEY") #'dired-recent-open)
   #+END_SRC
